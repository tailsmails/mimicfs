# MimicFS: Denial of Evidence

## The Forensic Gap
Modern mobile forensics relies on a fundamental assumption: Persistence. Tools used by state actors and private intelligence firms operate on the premise that user activity leaves permanent scarring on the NAND flash storage. Even if files are deleted, the wear-leveling algorithms of solid-state storage often preserve fragments of data long enough for physical extraction.

MimicFS rejects this premise. It is not merely an encryption tool; it is an anti-forensic framework designed to detach sensitive runtime environments from physical storage completely.

By pivoting the execution of sensitive packages into a volatile RAM bubble (tmpfs) and actively blinding system logging mechanisms, MimicFS ensures that the only evidence of activity is the heat generated by the processor. When the session ends-or if the device is compromised-the data does not need to be deleted. It simply ceases to have ever existed in a recoverable state.

## Architecture & Defense Mechanisms

### 1. Volatile Runtime Encapsulation
Standard Android encryption (FBE) is insufficient against a seized device with a compromised credential or a cold-boot attack. MimicFS alters the fundamental I/O of target applications.
*   **The Mechanism:** Upon activation, the target application's private data directory is overlaid with a RAM disk.
*   **The Pipeline:** Data is decrypted from a dormant, high-entropy archive, piped through ZSTD decompression, and written directly to memory.
*   **The Consequence:** During usage, absolutely zero write operations occur on the physical disk. All cache files, databases, and session tokens live in volatile memory. If the device loses power, the data evaporates instantly due to the physical properties of DRAM.

### 2. DeSpy: Hardware Interface Hardening
Software indicators are unreliable. A compromised operating system can record audio while showing a blank status bar. DeSpy ignores the user interface and establishes a direct line of interrogation with the hardware interfaces to ensure absolute environmental security.

*   **Direct Sensor State Polling:**
    Unlike standard privacy tools that monitor software permissions, DeSpy queries the actual power state and activity status of the hardware sensors. It continuously polls the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the Camera, Microphone, and GPS modules.
    If the hardware reports it is "Active" or "Collecting"-regardless of whether an app is visible on screen-DeSpy treats this as a hostile intrusion. It immediately alerts the user, allowing them to terminate the session before sensitive conversations or locations are compromised. This bypasses system-level "stealth modes" used by stalkerware or lawful interception tools.

*   **USB Logic Severance:**
    Modern extraction kiosks rely on ADB, MTP, or PTP protocols to handshake with the device. DeSpy preemptively neutralizes this vector by writing directly to the kernel's `configfs` parameters at `/config/usb_gadget`. It effectively unbinds the UDC (USB Device Controller) drivers. While the device will still draw power for charging, the data lanes are logically dead. The operating system refuses to enumerate as a USB peripheral, rendering external extraction tools blind.

### 3. System Blindness (Log Nullification)
Android is inherently noisy. `usagestats`, `dropbox` logs, and system snapshots create a breadcrumb trail of user activity even if the app data is secure. MimicFS neutralizes these observers by mounting void filesystems over critical logging paths before the target app launches.
The operating system continues to "write" logs to paths like `/data/system/usagestats` and `/data/tombstones`, but the data is piped into non-existence, defeating timeline reconstruction analysis.

### 4. The Panic Protocol (Scorched Earth)
In a coercion scenario, passive defense is not enough. MimicFS implements an active self-destruction trigger. Upon receiving the panic signal or detecting a triggering event (such as a specific magnetometer threshold indicating the device is being magnetically mounted for imaging):
1.  **Key Destruction:** Encryption keys in memory are shredded.
2.  **Binary Self-Deletion:** The executable overwrites itself with random noise.
3.  **RAM Purge:** All active containers are scrambled and unmounted.
4.  **Forced Reboot:** The device executes a hard reset.

## Deployment

**Prerequisites:**
*   Root Access (Magisk or KernelSU is mandatory).
*   Termux environment.
*   Standard Linux build tools.

**Compilation:**
Build the binary directly within the Termux environment to ensure library compatibility.

```bash
pkg update
pkg install vlang clang openssl zstd tar termux-api

# Clone and Compile
v -prod mimicfs.v -o mimicfs
```

**Execution:**
The tool must be executed with root privileges to manipulate file system mounts and kernel parameters. Do not move the binary to system partitions unless you have verified the hash; running it from the Termux home directory via `sudo` (or `tsu`) is the recommended operational standard.

```bash
# Assuming tsu is installed
sudo ./mimicfs
```

## Operation

The tool operates via a minimalist TUI to prevent GUI-based caching.

*   **[Add Target]:** Encrypts an existing app's data and creates the volatile archive. Original data on disk is shredded.
*   **[Mount/Start]:** Decrypts archive to RAM -> Mounts tmpfs -> Launches App.
*   **[Unmount/Stop]:** Syncs RAM changes to archive (optional) -> Shreds RAM -> Unmounts.
*   **[Daemon]:** Backgrounds the process to listen for sensor triggers and panic codes.
*   **[D. DeSpy]:** Engages the hardware locks (USB Kill and Direct Sensor Polling).

## Operational Warning

This software is provided "as is" for research into high-risk threat modeling. It assumes the user understands Linux filesystems and Android partition layouts.

If you are in a situation where you require this level of counter-forensics, you must understand that no software can guarantee safety against a determined state-level actor with unlimited resources. MimicFS buys you time and plausibility; it does not buy you immunity.

**Trust nothing. Verify everything.**
